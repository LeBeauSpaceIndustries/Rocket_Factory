DONATE and Support this Work:
These mods take many man hours to complete, and many of us are working professionals who do this on the side as well as work full time jobs.
Some of us do it because they love KSP, Personally I would love to quit my job and just make rocket parts all day, but work pays the bills.
So if someone wants to send me some money to make it a little easier to stay up lane one night to build ksp mods, this would be very very happy !
